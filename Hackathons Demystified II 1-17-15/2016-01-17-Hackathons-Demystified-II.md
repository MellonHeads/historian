## Hack To School
### Timeline
- Date: 1/17, 6:30-8 PM, Location: Doherty A302
- Our second official event of Spring 2015
- Facebook event: created on on 1/12/15. 
- Interested: 80, Attended: 46, Invited: 558
- _Actual Attendance: 50-60_

### Overview
- We had a new system for this hackathons demystified, to make this a lot more interactive
- Each person grabs a hackathon cheatsheet that has a number on the sheet, reserved for the raffle
- Each person would grab a post-it and post a question to the board, to be answered in a Q and A session later
- Avi did an intro on Mellonheads, our mission statement, and showcased the new D-list
- Showed hype videos for PennApps and MHacks
- Caroline presented "Balancing Schoolwork and Hackathons" with real-life examples on how to get out of school by sending well-written emails
- Q and A session was a tad long but a had lot of valuable information, lost a bit of steam towards the end. Answered a variety of beginner questions about going to hackathons. A bit less interaction I guess? 
- We prewrote the questions and grouped similar questions together...we should consolidate all of the questions and answers into a FAQ and make it public.
- At 7:40, broke out into teams. Assigned the last #s of the cheatsheet to randomly chosen words from the science.pdf list, a list for idea generation.
- Groups of 6/7, got team names, ideas, and choose someone to pitch the idea to the rest of the class
- Showcased a couple of demos of cool stuff built by Mellonheads during Winter
- 7 Teams, with Adult, Circus, Eyes, Roof, Sandwich (was the best).
- We had some very creative ideas and some very enthusiastic teams (sandwich was the best imo). 
- Pizza came a bit late at 8:50. Instead of 5 king kongs (they ran out of boxes), we got the equivalent of 15 large pizza instead. We had 1.5 boxes remaining.
- After complications, Po Shen Loh arrived 30 minutes late. He thought the event was actually Tuesday. Plugged Expii for a couple of minutes.
- Jake Zimmerman did a raffle based on the number on the cheatsheets for Tartanhacks. 3 people got admission to Tartanhacks.
- After the event ended, around 20 people hung around, some gathered around Po, some in small groups. 
- Doherty A302 was the best size. 50-60 people, wasn't too sparse.

    
### What we learned
- The event info was released at the good time. Should've have a bit more publicity but we have a fair amount of new people that came. Not as much as the first 
- Barely people left in the middle of the presentation. 
- Event was pretty engaging, but could've better
- The handouts were an amazing idea...we should compile everything and post on our website!
