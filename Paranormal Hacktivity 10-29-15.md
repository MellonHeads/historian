## Paranormal Hacktivity
### Timeline
- Date: 10/29, 8-10 PM, Location: WEH 6403 
- Our second official event was held before halloweekend.
- Ideas about another event around October 13th
- Heap sponorship confirmed October 21st
- Facebook event/graphics done October 26th

### Overview
- Sponsored by Heap rather an Expii, the plug was to send Heap with the subject “paranormal” for an interview
- Not that many people in the beginning, people started flowing in, but we only had a couple of costumes
- A big success, the watermelon suit was great, hail to Avi
- Bringing in the Oculus Rift and the Leap motion was a great idea, perhaps we can bring more hackathon related cool stuff
	- Perhaps we can bring a different hardware each time and teach people how to use it...like how to develop with a Kinect, how to develop with Leap, etc.
    - Hackathon preparation meetings, would be great to before Hackathons
- About 50 people came and went. Participation was mainly due to Mellonheads members personally inviting people. Shef brought 8 people from Pitt, Wilson brought 3 of his friends, Avi brought a couple people, etc. Turnout was great and popping.
- We ordered the same amount of food as last time, 4 King Kong Pizzas and bottles of soda. The food, unlike last time, was not finished instantly, we had a small amount of leftovers. We ordered pizza at 9PM to keep people here, and retention rate was quite high.
- We had signup sheets for us to keep track who came here, but not many people used it.
	- Perhaps we should have an electronic signup sheet like scottylabs?
- Some people came were slightly awkward and didn't feel integrated
	- Icebreakers for future events
- Room size was perfect, wasn't too sparse like PennApps there was room for people to converse in the back
    
### What we learned
- The event info was released a bit late. That means we have to plan events at least 3 weeks in advance, and release information 2 weeks in advance.
