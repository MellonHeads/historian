### Overview
- The Leap Motion and Oculus rift didn't attract a lot of people, wasn't setup correctly(?) The room was too sparse, not enough publicity?
- Showcased a couple of demos of cool stuff built by Mellonheads during Winter Break:
	- Avi's Meeting Minutes for his fraternity, built in a nifty new Javascript framework. Built in less than 500 lines of code.
    - Wilson presented a web-interfaced torrenting client, hosted on a Digital Ocean Droplet, and syncing files with rsync.
    - John Pascoe presented his auto-door opener to combat his lack of keys. It was worked great until it broke.
    - Tiffany showcased her shoe design and became a #sellout (lol jk) on Rooy.
- We still had the watermelon costume, but not as much hype or attention as last time
- About 40 people came and went. Participation was mainly due to Mellonheads members personally inviting people. We have a couple of repeating members that come (good news!)
- We ordered the same amount of food as last time, 4 King Kong Pizzas and bottles of soda. The food came almost immediately at 830, instead of at 9. At the end we finished 3 boxes of pizza, one box of pizza left.
- We didn't have any form of signup sheets.
- When we started people started breaking out into different tables. We had about 6 tables in expo format. People concentrated in 3 separate tables, while the other tables were empty.
- Room size was a bit bigger than the turnout, half the room was empty.
    
### What we learned
- The event info was released a bit late (again). Not enough time to build up hype, half the people didn't know until the days before. Although we planned the event a lot earlier, we still didn't publicize it early enough. (Facebook event hosted 5 days before the event.)
- A couple of people left in the middle. 
- Personal project demo's are super interesting and had a positive response. I personally had a lot of fun. We could even do current topics/debates, impromptu style. However, we should've presented earlier when there was more people.
	- Should we start presenting when the food arrives?
